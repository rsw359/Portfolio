      "description": "ðŸ‘‹ My name is Roger Wells and Iâ€™m a software engineer. Before I was an engineer, I was a teacher. I have a background in Education, having worked as a high school teacher for about 10 years. I value excellence in my code. I want to find the best way to do what needs to be done, even if that means that I have to learn new technologies. I enjoy design and working in CSS and Javascript. But I am very interested in data analysis and the backend, having focused on Python as my stack. One of my strengths is good communication. I love people, talking to people, and working on teams. What I bring to the table is ownership. I believe that I should strive to do the best I can to deliver the results that I am responsible for, but I am also keen to go above and beyond whenever possible. I like to find opportunities to improve on my work and further develop my skills. The thing that most excites me in tech is machine learning. Being able to teach a computer to do something that we need to get done is exciting. The possibilities are vast. Hopefully, we don't accidentally create SkyNet.",
