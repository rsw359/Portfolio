      "description": "ðŸ‘‹ My name is Roger Wells and Iâ€™m a software engineer. Before I was an engineer, I was a teacher in high schools tin Japan for about 10 years.  I enjoy design and working in CSS and Javascript. But I am very interested in data analysis and the backend, having focused on Python as my stack. One of my strengths is good communication. I love people, talking to people, and working on teams. What I try bring to the table is ownership. I believe that I should strive to do the best I can to deliver the results that I am responsible for, but I am also keen to go above and beyond whenever possible. The thing that most excites me in tech is machine learning. Being able to teach a computer to do something that we need to get done is exciting. Outside of work, I am a cyclist/photographer/audiophile.",
